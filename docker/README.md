## Build Docker Images

This folder contains Dockerfiles for building Docker images to use locally or with GitHub workflows.

Once you have built the Docker images on your system, you can simply run `./script/dockerized.sh`, and it will use these local images.
To Build the docker images, you'll need to install docker first
`sudo apt get docker`

Currently, the following Docker files are provided:

### Android Build:

    To build it, you will need 6 GB of free space and Docker installed.
    Then, open a terminal in the `u3d-android` subfolder and run:
    ```bash
    docker build -t u3d-android .
    ```
    (Youâ€™ll need to prefix this command with sudo if your Docker user permissions are not configured.)
    
### Windows Build: 
    
    use dockur/windows
